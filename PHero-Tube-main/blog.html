                        <p>null is a primitive value that represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is
                            explicitly assigned by developers to signify that a variable has no value or that it is
                            empty.
                            It can be used to reset or clear a variable that previously held an object reference.
                            It is often used in conditions to explicitly check if a value is absent or has been
                            intentionally set to null.</p>

                            </pre>
                        <h1 class="text-[1rem]"><small class="font-bold">Undefined:</small></h1>
                        <p>undefined is a primitive value that indicates a variable has been declared but has not been
                            assigned a value. It also represents the value returned by a function that does not
                            explicitly return anything.
                            Variables that are declared but not initialized are automatically assigned the value
                            undefined.
                            It is often used to check if a variable has been initialized or defined.</p>

                        What do you mean by REST API?

                        <pre>
                            REST API, which stands for Representational State Transfer Application 
                            Programming Interface, is an architectural style for designing networked 
                            applications. It is a set of principles and constraints that developers 
                            follow to create scalable and loosely coupled web services. REST is not 
                            a standard or protocol itself, but rather a set of guidelines and best 
                            practices.

                            Key principles and characteristics of RESTful APIs include:

                            1. Statelessness: Each request from a client to a server must contain
                             all the information needed to understand and fulfill that request. 
                             The server should not store any information about the client's state 
                             between requests.

                            2. Resource-Based: In a REST API, resources (such as data objects or 
                            services) are identified by URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers). 
                            Resources can be manipulated using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, 
                            PUT, and DELETE.

                            3. Representation: Resources are represented in a format that can be
                             easily consumed by the client, such as JSON or XML. The representation 
                             can include the current state of the resource and links to related 
                             resources.

                            4. Uniform Interface: REST APIs should have a uniform and consistent 
                            interface, which simplifies interactions and promotes scalability. This 
                            includes a common set of conventions for naming resources and using 
                            standard HTTP methods.

                            5. Stateless Communication: Communication between the client and 
                            server is stateless, meaning that each request from a client contains 
                            all the information needed to understand and process the request. The 
                            server does not store any information about the client's state between
                             requests.

                            6. Idempotence: Certain HTTP methods (such as GET, PUT, and DELETE) 
                            should be idempotent, meaning that multiple identical requests have the 
                            same effect as a single request. This ensures that making the same 
                            request multiple times does not produce different outcomes.

                            RESTful APIs are widely used in web development for building scalable 
                            and interoperable systems. They are often preferred for their simplicity,
                            scalability, and compatibility with HTTP, making them suitable for a 
                            variety of applications, including web and mobile development.
